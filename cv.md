# Projects

Below is a small selection of my own projects or projects I'm involved in:

2013 — present

:   **Rust compiler.** Implement a [b-tree](http://github.com/smvv/rust-btree)
    for the Rust standard library, and add an [alias
    analysis](https://github.com/mozilla/rust/issues/6750) pass to rustc.

2013 — present

:   **Iron.** Implement a Rust web framework called
    [Iron](http://github.com/smvv/iron).

2011 — 2012

:   **Mathematical term rewriting system.** Given a user-written math
    expression, the system will generate all rewrite possibilities. It will
    verify the user's rewrite steps and, upon request, it will display the best
    step to rewrite the expression. Online demo:
